    <p>
      The VIM website redesign is the key to cultivating a more enjoyable experience while exploring all fashion, beauty and lifestyle needs on MSU's campus.
    </p>

    <p>VIM magazine is the go-to fashion, beauty, and lifestyle guide for MSU students. From blog posts about internship advice to behind-the-scenes photoshoot content, we deliver an abundance of diverse content for all MSU students to enjoy. Many students have even come to depend on the website to explore the digital versions of the magazines and read the blog posts. For this reason, it is crucial that the website is both easy to use and visually appealing simultanously. The site redesign will ensure that MSU users will keep coming back and enjoy their experience while on the site even more than before.</p>
